# Building a Spam Classifier with FastAPI

In the digital age, spam emails pose considerable challenges to users, necessitating robust solutions for effective management. This essay outlines the development of a spam classification web application using FastAPI, a modern Python web framework, coupled with pre-trained machine learning models and vectorization techniques.

## Problem Definition and Data Acquisition

The goal of spam detection is to automatically classify incoming emails as either spam (unwanted or harmful) or ham (legitimate communication). Implementing an effective spam detection system helps improve user experience, reduces phishing risks, and enhances the overall quality of email communications.

I used dataset in csv file structure, This dataset is used for training models to classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The effectiveness of the model depends on its ability to accurately distinguish between the two categories.

The dataset can be used with algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks to automate the detection of spam emails. But i used Navie Bayes in this project.

## Application Structure

This FastAPI application consists of several key components:

Model and Vectorizer Loading: The application begins by loading the trained spam classification model and the vectorizer using the Joblib library. This setup allows for swift execution of predictions on new email inputs.

```python
model = joblib.load("./model/spam_classifier.joblib")  
vectorizer = joblib.load("./model/vectorizer.joblib")
```
## Web Application Setup

An instance of the FastAPI application is created, while templates and static files are configured to enable a rich user interface that displays the prediction results.

```python
app = FastAPI()  
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="templates")  
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
```
## Input Model Definition

A Pydantic model named EmailInput is defined to structure the incoming data. This model validates that the input is a string containing the email text.

```python
class EmailInput(BaseModel):  
 text: str
```
Routing and Logic
The application implements two main routes:

The root ("/") route renders the home page with an HTML template.

```python
@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)  
async def read_root(request: Request):  
 return templates.TemplateResponse("index.html", {"request": request})
```
The prediction route ("/predict/") processes the input email, applying preprocessing and utilizing the loaded model for classification.

```python
@app.post("/predict/")  
async def predict_spam(email: EmailInput):
```
## Prediction logic

Prediction Logic
The prediction process involves several steps:

```python
def predict_email(text):
    text = vectorizer.transform([text])
    prediction = model.predict(text)[0]
    return "Spam" if prediction == 1 else "Ham"
```

## Text Preprocessing

The input text is transformed to lower case. Additional preprocessing, such as removing punctuation, can be added as needed.

```python
def preprocess_text(text: str):  
 return text.lower()
```

Vectorization: The preprocessed email text is vectorized using the previously loaded vectorizer.

Model Prediction: The model predicts whether the email is spam or not. The output is appropriately formatted and returned in the response.

## Error Handling

To maintain robustness, the application incorporates error handling using FastAPIâ€™s HTTPException. This ensures that any unexpected issues during the prediction process are logged and a user-friendly message is returned.

```python
try:  
        # Preprocess the input text and vectorize it  
        preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(email.text)  # Preprocess the input  
        email_vectorized = vectorizer.transform([preprocessed_text])  # Vectorize the preprocessed text  
        
        # Predict using the model  
        prediction = model.predict(email_vectorized)[0]  # Predict  
        
        # Return the result based on the model output  
        return {  
            "prediction": "This message is Spam, Be aware" if prediction == 1 else "This message is not Spam, You can read it"  
        }  
    
    except Exception as e:  
        # Log the exception and return an error response  
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"An error occurred during prediction: {str(e)}")  
```

## Conclusion

This FastAPI application for spam classification illustrates an efficient integration of web technologies with machine learning models. By following a simple structure that includes model loading, a user-friendly interface, and robust error handling, developers can swiftly reproduce and deploy similar projects in the future. With the growing risks of spam in modern communication, such systems are essential to enhance user experiences and improve email management strategies.
